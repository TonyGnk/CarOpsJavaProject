## 📋 Project Overview

In the field of software development, building a successful information system requires several stages and processes. By studying the case of the "CarOps" workshop, we can understand how knowledge and application of these steps play a crucial role in the success of an information system.

The project follows the stages of Preparation, Analysis, Design, and Implementation. Each stage contributes to different aspects of the system development:

### 📑 Preparation

In this stage, the team defines the system's goals and conducts various analyses and studies to understand the workshop's requirements. Key activities include:

- System Request: An official document describing the project's desired outcomes, as submitted by the workshop owner.
- Feasibility Analysis: Evaluating the workshop's needs and constraints to determine if the proposed information system is suitable.

### 🔍 Analysis

During this stage, the team analyzes the workshop's requirements and designs a system proposal. Key activities include:

- Analysis Strategy: Developing an approach to analyze the current system and identify improvement opportunities.
- Requirement Gathering: Collecting and documenting the workshop's requirements and incorporating them into a system proposal.

### ✍️ Design

The Design stage focuses on planning the system and specifying its characteristics and functionalities. Key activities include:

- Use Case Diagrams: Representing the system's interactions and illustrating the relationships between actors and use cases.
- Sequence Diagrams: Visualizing the system's functionality during interactions, providing insights for developers.

### 💻 Implementation

The final stage involves the actual coding of the system based on the previously designed diagrams and plans. Key activities include:

- Object-Oriented Design: Implementing classes, objects, and their relationships as per the design.
- JavaFX GUI Development: Creating a graphical user interface using the JavaFX library.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **code**: This directory contains all the source code for the CarOps Information System. It includes the Java code for the graphical user interface and the backend functionalities, as well as any other necessary files.

- **documentation**: This directory contains the project documentation, including the system request document, system proposal document, and design diagrams. Additionally, it includes the Greek language version of the project report in PDF format.
